    <string name="popup_what_flow_title">What is Flow?</string>
    <string name="popup_what_flow"><b>Flow</b> is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is <b>fully immersed</b> in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. \n\nIn essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting <b>transformation in one\'s sense of time</b>. </string>

    <string name="notsureyet">Flow is important both because it makes the present instant <b>more enjoyable</b>, and because it <b>builds the self-confidence</b> that allows us to develop skills and make significant contributions to humankind.</string>

    <string name="popup_why_flow_title">Why identify you Flow conditions?</string>
    <string name="popup_why_flow">People who learn to control inner experience will be able to <b>determine</b> the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to <b>being happy</b>.</string>
